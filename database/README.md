# Database Setup

This directory will hold database-related files, including migrations.

## Migrations
Migrations will be stored in the `migrations/` subdirectory.
To run migrations (example command, replace with actual later):
```bash
# flask db upgrade
```

## Database Connection
Details on how to connect to the database will be provided here once a specific database system is chosen (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).

For now, ensure your backend application is configured to point to the chosen database.
